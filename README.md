# threw_together_program
I seriously just slapped this program together.\
It works for now, but if it breaks in the future, that’s on you guys — good luck! ★\
Feel free to use it, just don’t say you made it yourself, alright?\
Honestly, I can’t even think of a situation where this would be useful lol.
## Why does this exist?
Honestly, I got tired of debugging OS stuff and setting up Python servers, so I made this as a little break.\
It’s also kind of a practice project for myself.\
If you find any syntax errors or have no idea how to use it, feel free to open an issue.\
By the way, I can’t speak English at all, so my replies will probably be in Japanese (or maybe English if I’m in the mood)... \
please forgive me!!!!
